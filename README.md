# Getting started
## Basis Structure

php-framework is a MVC framework. You build your web-app in:

    php-framework/app/

Your controllers are in:

    php-framework/app/controller/

There is already a example controller *index_public.php*. So you can open your root directory in a web-browser. Try *localhost* in your browser.

## Creating our first Model - "User"

First we want to create a User model to store data of a user. User can store a first name and a last name.

Go to the directory:

    php-framework/console/

Now execute:

    ./model create User firstName:string lastName:string

Now we have to migrate the user into our database:

    ./migrate -m User

## Creating a controller for "User"

To access the User by browser, we need a simple default controller. We can create this controller with:

    ./model create-controller User

Now you can open the web-page *"localhost/public/users"* Don't forget the 's'.
